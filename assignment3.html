        <p>Describe the following:
        <ul>
            <li><dfn>IP address</dfn> - an IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a
                local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol". There are two versions of IP: IPv4, 32-bit addresses
                consisting of four numbers ranging from 0 to 255, separated by period, and IPv6, 128-bit with eight
                groups of four hexadecimal digits.</li>
            <li><dfn>network subnets</dfn> - a logical subdivision of an IP network. Computers that belong to the same
                subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in
                their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields: the network
                number and host identifier. Host identifier is an identifier for a
                specific host or network interface.</li>
            <li><dfn>network classes</dfn>
                <img src="https://embeddedgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ip_Class-1.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li><dfn>network mask</dfn> - number of subnet bits. Consists of an uninterrupted sequence of 1's and a
                complementary block of 0's. Network mask is used in subnetting.</li>
            <li><dfn>routing table</dfn> - is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to
                particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes.
            </li>
            <li><dfn>default
                    gateway</dfn> - The Gateway Address is the Address of the router
                where the packet should be sent in case the
                destination host does not belong to the same subnet.</li>
            <li><dfn>broadcast</dfn> - the last
                address in the network is the Broadcast Address (it's assignment cannot be changed). It serves as a way
                to send the data to all nodes in the network.</li>
            <li><dfn>subnet address</dfn> - A standard Internet Protocol address field has two parts: a network address
                and a local address. To make subnets possible, the local address part of an Internet address is divided
                into a subnet number and a host number.<a
                    href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=addressing-subnet-addresses"></a></li>
            <li><dfn>private network address</dfn> - a computer network that uses a private address space of IP
                addresses. These addresses are commonly used for local area networks (LANs) in residential, office, and
                enterprise environments. Private network addresses for IPv4:

            </li>
            <li><dfn>network address translation</dfn> - a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public
                one before transferring the information. Is done by changing the header of IP packets while in transit
                via a router.</li>
