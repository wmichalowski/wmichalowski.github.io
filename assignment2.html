            <li><strong>MAC address, broadcasting</strong></li>
            <p>A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface
                controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is
                common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the
                OSI network model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control (MAC) protocol sublayer of the
                data
                link layer. As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal
                digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator</p>
            <p><strong> Broadcasting:</strong>

                Broadcast MAC destination addresses are used by the source to forward a packet to all hosts on the
                network. A broadcast packet contains a destination IP address that has all ones (1s) in the host
                portion. This
                numbering in the address means that all hosts on that local network (broadcast domain) will receive and
                process the packet. Broadcast IP address for a network needs a corresponding broadcast MAC address in
                the Ethernet frame. On Ethernet networks, the broadcast MAC address is 48 ones displayed as hexadecimal
                FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.
            </p>
            <li><strong>The difference between hub, switch and router</strong>
                <p> They work on different ISO OSI layers:
                <ul>
                    <li> Hub – works on layer 1, a passive device, forwards all signals to all ports.</li>
                    <li>Switch – works on layer 2 (usually), joins devices into one network, passes frames exactly to
                        the
                        devices
                        identified by their MAC addresses.</li>
                    <li>Router – works on layer 3, routes packets across different networks (chooses the most
                        efficient way
                        for them).
                    </li>
                </ul>


                </p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>CSMA/CD, collision, half and full duplex</strong></li>
            <p>Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is a medium access control (MAC) method
                used for local area networking. It uses carrier-sensing to
                defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting. This is used in combination with collision
                detection in which a transmitting station detects collisions by sensing transmissions from other
                stations while it is transmitting a frame. When this collision condition is detected, the station stops
                transmitting that frame, transmits a jam signal, and then waits for a random time interval before trying
                to resend the frame.</p>

            <p>A duplex communication system is a point-to-point system composed of two or more connected parties or
                devices that can communicate with one another in both directions.</p>
            <p>In a half-duplex or semiduplex system, both parties can communicate with each other, but not
                simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. In a full-duplex system, both parties can
                communicate with each other simultaneously.</p>
            <li><strong>ARP request, detecting doubled IP address</strong></li>
            <p>Address resolution protocol – is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address,
                such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.</p>
            <p>Before sending the data, a computer creates a broadcast ARP frame, which is sent to all the devices in
                the same network. Source address field of the frame includes information about the address of the source
                computer, target address field includes the broadcast MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). Each of the
                devices that receive the frame decapsulates it into the form of a packet and checks if target field
                includes its IP address. If the address is different, packet is ignored. If the address is correct, it
                will create a new frame, that will include its MAC address. In an event of doubled IP address in the
                network, for one ARP request, there are two responses.</p>
            <li><strong>BOOTP, DHCP</strong></li>
            <p> <strong>The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)</strong> is a computer networking protocol used in Internet
                Protocol networks to
                automatically assign an IP address to network devices from a configuration server. When a
                network-connected computer boots up, its IP stack broadcasts BOOTP network messages requesting an
                IP-address assignment. A BOOTP configuration-server replies to the request by assigning an IP address
                from a pool of addresses, which is preconfigured by an administrator.</p>
            <p> <strong>DHCP</strong> is a newer technology based on BOOTP, but can dynamically allocate IP addresses
                from a pool and
                reclaim them when they
                are no longer in use. It can also be used to deliver a wide range of extra configuration parameters to
                IP clients, including platform-specific parameters.</p>
            <li><strong>VLANs</strong></li>
            <p>LANS separated logically by software on data link layer. VLANs are implemented through the software of
                switch. VLANs work by applying tags to network frames and handling these tags in networking systems –
                creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but
                acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications
                separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of
                cabling and networking devices to be deployed.</p>

            <li><strong>Find the producer of your network adapter</strong></li>
            <p>The producer of teh Network Interface Card can be discriminated by looking up the first three bytes of
                the
                MAC Address on one of the many sites.</p>
            <p>Wireshark is also able to look up the NIC Vendors and help with the analysis.</p>

            <li><strong>Set the same IP address on two different hosts in the lab and detect it using arp
                    request</strong>
            </li>
            <p>Firstly, static IPs were set for two virtual machines.</p>
            <p>To send an ARP request, <i>arping</i> may be utilised.</p>

            <li><strong>Using Wireshark save the packets required to obtain IP address through DHCP</strong></li>
            <p>When a new client connects to a network, DHCP is responsible for providing an IP address for the host.
            </p>
            <p>Wireshark was used to capture the packets required to obtain an IP address through DHCP.</p>
            <img src="images/task_2/dhcp.png" alt="DHCP packets">

            <li><strong>Release and renew IP address using ipconfig</strong></li>
            <p>On a Linux client, one may release the DHCP lease by using: sudo dhclient -r</p>
            <p>Once that is done, we may proceed to renew the DHCP lease using the command: sudo dhclient</p>
            <p>On a Windows host, the same thing may be achieved with the help of ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew
            </p>

            <p>Due to the scrict policy of the virtual machines in the virtual network, this exercise had to be done in
                the
                real network.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the MAC address of one computer was changed to the MAC address of the other computer.</p>

            <img src="images/task_2/changed_mac.png" alt="MAC of the laptop">
            <p>As soon as we set the same MAC address for both devices, the second computer that had the MAC changes
                momentarily picked up the IP address of the first computer.</p>
